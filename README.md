The given graph cannot be solved through prims and kruskals algorithm 

Prims and kruskals algorithm works when all the vertices in the graph are connected. 

Since the given graph is a directed graph,not all the vertices are connected so prims and kruskals algorithms fails in this situation. 

While trying dijkstras algorithm it is found that the least distance can be found correctly to some extent. 

Only one contradition arrises[at node d]. 

Since negative edge[5] is being used from e->d ,the shortest length from a->d also changes from 5-1 

So it is said that among the 3 algorithms ,dijstras algorithm is most effective.
